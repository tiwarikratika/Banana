<h2>Have you ever wondered that the 
language that minions speak is actually a language?</h2>

Well if not, You are at the right place. 

I have created this fun translation app which converts our English language to minion-language.
Surprising? Isn't it?

I have made use of Javascript to write the code.
And the API that i have used for translation is taken from

<h2>What is VanillaJS?</h2>
The term vanilla script is used to refer to the pure
JavaScript (or we can say plain JavaScript) without any type of additional library. 
So basically, I have written this app using pure JAvascript without ny other libraries.

<h2>What is an API? </h2>

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
